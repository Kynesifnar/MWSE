# Introduction

This module implements conversion functions between okhsv and sRGB color spaces as described in the following blog posts:

# Usage


There is `init.lua` that loads compiled `dll` and defines some wrapper Lua functions for easier usage.

```lua
local oklab = require("livecoding.oklab")
```

# Building

To build this module you will need a C++ compiler. I used MSYS2 distribution of GCC.

To start the 32-bit bash on 64-bit Windows run the following command in CMD:
```bat
C:\\msys64\\mingw32.exe bash
```

Then navigate to this folder. To compile, run the following two commands in bash:
```sh
gcc -c liboklab.cpp -o liboklab.o
gcc -shared -o liboklab.dll liboklab.o


gcc -c libhsv.cpp -o libhsv.o
gcc -shared -o libhsv.dll libhsv.o
```
